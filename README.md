# MPath-Test-Environment
A demo of the simple test environment I made for my game, M:/Path
----------------------------------------------------------------
Obviously very rough, but this is the enviroment I've been using to test AI, animations, collisions, player character controls, etc. 
I'm using an API for the AI(which isn't working yet) and used the help of some tutorials for the player controller. 
ALL of the art you see is my own, I made it with a drawing program and a Wacom drawing tablet.

**************Currently doesn't seem to be a way to exit the demo without Ctrl-Alt-Delete --> Task Manager.******************
